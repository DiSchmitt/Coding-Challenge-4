# Coding-Challenge-4
For this coding challenge, We need to extend the car class from the third challenge to make an 'EV' class.
We need to add an extra property, 'charge' for this new class that can be increased with the method: 'chargeBattery' and have it reduce by 1 every time the car accelerates. 
Finnally, we need to test the accelerate, brake, and chargeBattery methods.
